We become our incentives

To improve health, gamify it

Allow people to collect "health points" by participating in vetted events/workshops/programs

More points = bigger discounts on monthly premiums 

The Healthscore forms a basis for incentivizing health individually and professionally

INDIVIDUALS
- The better your score, the lower your disease insurance premiums
- Seeing one's score improve is motivating feedback to continue making progress and maintain momentum


PROFESSIONALS
- A measuring stick for effectiveness
- Effectiveness ratio: Relationship between $ spent and healthscore delta
- The more effective you are at helping others, the more you are rewarded (more people, more money in fewer visits)
- Align compensation with health improvement, not with number of visits/interventions
- Pros who can achieve more improvement using less resources are rewarded
- Curate a network of the most effective pros

Ideas:
- Baseline survey before working with a pro, enter amount spent with the pro, track progress and get end score. Points improvement per $100 spent on care
- Baseline survey before using a digital tool, points improvement after finished commitment with tool


Points system
- proof of work system whereby Crowdhealth members can accumulate points by attending health workshops and events
- Events would be facilitated by vetted partners in the community. Events would offer "health points" which can be submitted for monthly premium discounts

- A physical screen could be offered by health professionals in the community to identify areas of opportunity
- Screen appointment: 45 minutes, 5 physical screens and a questionaire. $50 cost, covered by Crowdhealth if data can be collected
- Screen results allow for discounts on premiums if they show reduced risk of musculoskeletal injury/disease
- Getting screened twice a year would be like a dental hygiene model. Detect issues before they become something bigger, point to resources to help
