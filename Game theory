We become our incentives

The Healthscore forms a basis for incentivizing health 1) individually, 2) professionally

INDIVIDUALS
- The better your score, the lower your disease insurance premiums
- Seeing one's score improve is motivating feedback to continue making progress and maintain momentum


PROFESSIONALS
- A measuring stick for effectiveness
- Effectiveness ratio: 
- Game theory: the more effective you are at helping others, the more you are rewarded (more people, more money in fewer visits)
- Align compensation with health improvement, not with number of visits/interventions
- Pros who can achieve more improvement using less resources are rewarded



Ideas:
- Baseline survey before working with a pro, enter amount spent with the pro, track progress and get end score. Points improvement per $100 spent on care
- Baseline survey before using a digital tool, points improvement after finished commitment with tool
