Basic logic: The healthier you are, the less likely you are to have an adverse health event and require disease care 

If we can accurately assess current level of health, we can better determine coverage risk and incentivize health monetarily

Feedback benefit: If individuals can take a monthly survey to assess their health, they can obtain feedback that helps with motivation and momentum

A tool to assess and also to expand awareness. Everything starts with awareness

Voluntary: data tracking (heart rate, steps, weekly surveys) for further discounts on monthly premium

Health points awarded for attending vetted community programs: The more time/money you spend on your health, the less you pay in disease insurance

20 points = 2-5% reduction in monthly premium. Vetted teachers, they take attendance and rate engagement level (proof of work)

8 week meditation class (twice a week) = 20 points
8 week food class (twice a week) = 20 points


Work:
- Review car insurance model
- Review credit score model

Value of Healthscore:

- Intake/baseline screen for an internal score
- A general health score
- A measuring stick to incentivize health
- An effectiveness scorecard for health pros (ratings posted in p2p network)


- Weighted scoring (more important = higher weighted)
- Distributed across pillars
- Reward honesty: discounted premiums based on improvement, not only current state 

Question types: scoring questions, feedback questions (what do they want to learn about?)
