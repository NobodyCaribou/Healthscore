Mission: develop a general health metric that

1) Serves as a valid and relaible measure of general health
2) Indentifies individual and collective education opportunities


Combination of subjective & objective questions

Questions distributed across 6 pillars of health, weighted scoring

Individual utility: a feedback mechanism to measure one's health progress

Professional utility: a feedback tool that measures the effectiveness of interventions

Non scoring questions serve as indicators of health education opportunities


Parallel - credit score

Based on credit history (disease care spending history) & current credit worthiness (health state)

Used to calculate risk (credit: interest rates, crowdhealth: monthly premiums)
